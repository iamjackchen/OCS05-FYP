# OCS05 (C++) FYP

This is my final year project for Programming in C++ (OCS05), taken in 2019-2020. The project consists of two parts: a post-fix expression evaluator, and an unbeatable tic-tac-toe game. As an additional side challenge I built a custom GUI for both parts using SDL2 and my amateurish photoshop skills. 


## Postfix Expression Evaluator

This app evaluates post-fix expressions by means of a stack. The program iterates through each character in the expression, delimited by a space. Operands are pushed onto the stack. Operators are applied to the top-most two items on the stack (and the result is pushed onto the stack). 

The stack is implemented as a dynamically allocated array whose length adjusts throughout runtime for memory efficiency.

All GUI components are custom-built. SDL2 provides low-level access to I/O and graphics hardware; it is not a GUI library per se, so it doesn't have a built-in UI components. Building buttons with a hover effect was fairly simple. More notably, I built my own [textbox component](https://github.com/iamjackchen/OCS05-FYP/blob/main/PostFixProj/src/gui/inputTextboxHandler.hpp) that calculates substring render widths (using elementary arithmetic) in order to handle cursor positioning and support text wrapping and selection.


### Features:
* Verbose mode (see bottom right screenshot). Provides error printouts when expression evaluation fails
* Works with decimal values (but negative numbers... yet)
* Clipboard integration. Textbox input supports select-all, cut, copy, and paste operations. Output display supports select-all and copy
